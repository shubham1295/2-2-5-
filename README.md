# 2 + 2 = 5 ! :scream:
Here I am trying to output 5 when we add 2 with 2 programmatically. :nerd_face:

### Explanation
We are using Java's abality of doing [Reflection](https://www.baeldung.com/java-reflection) .
```javascript
Class cache = Integer.class.getDeclaredClasses()[0];
```
Here from the Integer class we are getting the Integer cache class
```javascript
Integer[] array = (Integer[]) c.get(cache);
```
put in into an array of size **256** ( in int class low is set to -128 and high is set to 127 ).
![Integer.class](Integer class.png)

In this class it creates a cache of Integer objects,
```javascript
static final int low = -128;

int h = 127;

int size = (high - low) + 1;

Integer[] c = new Integer[size];

c[i] = new Integer(j++);
```
and reuse this cache when int form this range is used.

```javascript
array[132] = array[133];
```
So the 132th element is **4** and 133th element is **5**, we replaced 4 with 5, now whenever 4 shows up in my code it will show 5 insted.

### Still dont agree with this explination ? :astonished:
Use [this calculator](https://www.noisemeters.asia/apps/db-calculator/)  which gives 2+2=5 using proper formula. :boom:
